This program allows the RIO to communicate with a Raspberry Pi Pico, which outputs a colour/effect to the LED strip connected to the Raspberry Pi Pico.

Currently, the communication protocol being used is UART, however it may change to SPI or a different communication protocol.

The files are programmed in Micropython, however, they can be programmed in the Arduino IDE as well (supports both). It will be decided whether this is necessary or not.
