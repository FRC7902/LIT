This program allows the RIO to communicate with a Raspberry Pi Pico, which outputs a colour/effect to the LED strip connected to the Raspberry Pi Pico.

Currently, the communication protocol being used is UART, however it may change to SPI or a different communication protocol.

The current file is programmed in C++ via the Arduino IDE. There exists a Micropython version, however, this version is now deprecated and will only be used for debugging purposes.
